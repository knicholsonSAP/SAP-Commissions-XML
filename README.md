# SAP-Commissions-XML

I've created an Excel workbook with a few macro's that read from a SAP Commissions xml file and load the contents of it into an easy to read format.

I've personally used this file many times to assess new requirements, check my plan design for errors and many other things.

If you have any suggestions for improvements, please make use of the GitHub Issues and/or Pull Requests.
